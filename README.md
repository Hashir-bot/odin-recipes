# odin-recipes
A small website for delicious recipes

Through this I will demonstrate html skills I learned through 
the odin project which include the html boilerplate, paragraph 
tags, strong/emphasis tags, heading tags, the ordered and 
unordered list tags, the anchor tag and the image along with 
their respective attributes.
